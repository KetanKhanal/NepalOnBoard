    "content": "After completing Higher Secondary School/ College, it is no surprise that you and most of your friends and peers wish and plan to study abroad. It is the dream of many and every year thousands of students flock to countries like USA, Australia, UK, Japan and many more to pursue further studies. I was also one of many and itâ€™s been almost four years now that I have been in Australia.</br></br> Living independently has taught me many things and helped me discover my true self. Living by yourself is not an easy task especially for us Nepalese who are so used to staying with our tightly knit families and communities. You basically have to start form scratch and need to make sure that you are mentally ready to take this step in your life. Determination and persistence is the key factor that helped me achieve my goals that I wanted to achieve as an aspiring student. When I was in the same position as you are right now, I thought that life would be easier when I start living by myself and let me tell you- I was so wrong. You have to take care of every little thing that you take for granted right now and you get a heap load of responsibilities in your head.</br></br>Adult life begins and there is nothing much to do except accept it as it comes.Not to intimidate you but I know and have heard of fellow peers who have come abroad and could not handle the stress that came with living this life. You have to juggle your academic, social and work life. The challenge is trying to keep a balance between these three and excelling in all. Nevertheless, it is a life changing experience and a path to self- discovery. I would say that it is a great learning experience and an opportunity for you to achieve the goals that you have set for yourself.",
